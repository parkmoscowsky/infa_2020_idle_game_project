# infa_2020_idle_game_project

We're creating an idle game (if you don't know what it is or want to know more about it, it is easily googleable).

We have not yes come to conclusion on plot, but graphics will be particularly easy, mostly shown in minigame which we want to add also.

This description and the project will be developed in the next couple of weeks.
